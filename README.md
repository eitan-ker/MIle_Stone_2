Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

Prerequisites
OS Linux Ubuntu
files from git
matrices that will be representing problem
attached python code to run on terminal
How to Run Code:
1.move all the files to a Project in C-lion except for the contents of folder "task" 
2.run the project - wait for message "server is now connected"
3.navigate to "task\HW4_Files" folder and open terminal inside the folder. write "python3 parallel_tester"
4.now you can see all the solutions for matrices in output of lion and in files named after the hash code of the specific matrix's content
