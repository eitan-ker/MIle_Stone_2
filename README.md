# Handling Requests from Multiple Clients

This project, developed as part of the Advanced Programming course in the Sophomore year, focuses on handling requests from multiple clients with different problems and providing them with solutions from the cache or local disk file. It practices problem-solving and the use of appropriate design patterns to solve the problem, using the Bridge design pattern.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- Operating System: Linux Ubuntu
- Git repository files
- Matrices representing the problems (attached)
- Python code to run in the terminal

### How to Run the Code

1. Move all the files to a project in CLion, excluding the contents of the "task" folder.
2. Run the project and wait for the message "server is now connected".
3. Navigate to the "task/HW4_Files" folder and open the terminal inside the folder.
4. Run the command `python3 parallel_tester`.
5. You can now see all the solutions for the matrices in the output of CLion and in files named after the hash code of the specific matrix's content.
